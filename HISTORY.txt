      This also fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6943.

statusmessages 2.0 - Released May 15, 2006

    - Total reimplementation using cookies instead of a server-side in-memory
      storage to store status messages. The reasoning behind this change is that
      the former approach didn't play well with web caching strategies and added
      an additional burden in ZEO environments (having to use load-balancers,
      which are able to identify users and keep them connected to the same ZEO
      server).
